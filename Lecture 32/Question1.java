java.lang is a package which contains many fundamental classes used in writing Java code. It is present in JDK and JRE installations.

For example, it contains classes like :
Object - The Object class is the root class of all classes in Java.
System - The System class provides access to the standard input, output and error streams of the running Java program. It also has many other useful methods.
Wrapper Classes - Whenever we want to represent a primitive int value as an object, we use its wrapper class Integer. The java.lang package contains all the wrapper classes: Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Integer, Long, Float and Double.
String, StringBuilder classes.
Math - The Math class contains many useful methods for numeric operations like the square root, power, trigonometric operations etc.
Class - The class called Class represents the loaded classes and interfaces in memory during runtime.
Other classes - The java.lang package also has many other useful classes like ClassLoader, Process, Runtime, Thread, Runnable, Throwable, Exception, Error, etc.
All public classes present in java.lang package (like the classes mentioned above) are by default imported in every Java class. Meaning, we can directly start using these classes without using the import statement.
